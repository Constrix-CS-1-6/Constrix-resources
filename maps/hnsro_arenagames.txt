I would like to introduce you my high-end hns map that i started many years ago.
It was designed to maintain players mood on a medium size map, built up with love and lots of hours testing and building up every detail.
On this map there are alot of ways to outrun youre enemy! 


Map features:

3 secret rooms that can be accessed trough a false wall.

-first room placed on ct side feautures TV showing a new map hns_winter and this room as well it can be accessed from both sides of the building droping down into the false wall. (look at photos)
   
-second room placed on Tspawn features 2 ways to enter / exit and an TV showing a picture of hnsro_aztec map.

-third room placed on Tspawn features 2 ways to go in and out and there is also an TV showing a picture of hns_vicecity map.


2 teleport locations hidden on the map.

- first teleport placed inside the vent that is on a building in Tspawn. (look at photos)

- second teleport placed on Tspawn, can be accessed droping down from a ladder.

- both teleport zones sends you to one of the two highest pole on the map.

- boost zones that can be accessed only boosting up a team player.

- ladders alot of them well done placed and designed so you can be creative !

Enjoy ! also i would like to ask you to leave a comment, tell me what do you think about this project !
